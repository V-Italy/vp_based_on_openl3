# vp_based_on_openl3

Anaconda3 was used as a distribution kit. At the initial stage, you need to create and activate an environment variable:

```Shell
conda create -n myenv python=3.8
conda activate myenv
'''


The next step is to install the following packages:

```Shell
pip install openl3
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
'''
